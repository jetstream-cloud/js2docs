# Horizon Troubleshooting

### I just made a change in a menu item (add/delete/modify) but the screen stays the same.

* Try clicking on a different menu item and/or force refreshing the browser ( shift-⌘R on Mac OS)

---

### I can manage instances in Horizon, but CLI doesn't work

* You are likely not using `Application Credentials` in your openrc file. See [CLI openrc](/ui/cli/openrc) for instructions
